# Operations

Toposcope is a single-node deployment: one app instance plus one ClickHouse. It does not provide high availability.

Auth is required except `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/metrics`. There is no default password or ingest token.

The packaged image is pinned to `ghcr.io/toposcope/toposcope:0.3.14` and should not be replaced with `:latest`.

For the initial deployment and first searchable event, follow the [README quick start](../README.md#quick-start). This guide covers the ongoing operation of that packaged stack.

## TLS

Terminate TLS on a reverse proxy you already run, such as Caddy, nginx, or Traefik on the host.

Proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and pass `Authorization`. The packaged Compose file does not include a reverse proxy and keeps the application bound to loopback; do not publish it on `0.0.0.0:8080`.

Example:

```text
toposcope.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

## Runtime ports and network

- App: `127.0.0.1:8080`
- ClickHouse: stays on the Docker network and is not published
- Syslog UDP: `127.0.0.1:5514`
- OTLP JSON and protobuf: the existing HTTP port on `/v1/logs`, `/v1/traces`, and `/v1/profiles`
- Metric points: `POST /v1/metrics` on the same port and ingest token
- Change marks: `POST /v1/marks` on the same port and ingest token; `GET /api/marks` lists them
- `GET /api/metrics`: Prometheus text, unauthenticated

## Upgrade and retention

Boot is idempotent. No volume wipe is required for a normal upgrade.

Update the application image pin in `compose.yml`, then pull and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

- ClickHouse tables such as `logs_by_minute` and `logs_attr_values_by_minute` are created on boot, and missing day partitions are backfilled from `logs`.
- SQLite adds new tables and columns on boot.
- Retention follows `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "retention_days": 30 }` and accepts values from 1 to 365.
- TTL is always `toDate(ts) + INTERVAL n DAY`, never `TTL ts + …`.
- The `ALTER` does not wait for `MATERIALIZE TTL` (`alter_sync = 0`), and SQLite is written first.
- `spans`, `profile_samples`, and `change_marks` are created on boot.

ClickHouse 26.3 is the supported LTS line. If an older ClickHouse data directory refuses to start after a 24.8 → 26.3 migration, restore the data instead of pinning a different tag.

## Backup and restore

Stop the stack, then copy both volumes: ClickHouse `ch_data` and SQLite `app_data`.

```bash
docker compose down
docker run --rm -v toposcope_ch_data:/data -v "$(pwd)":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/ch_data.tgz -C /data .
docker run --rm -v toposcope_app_data:/data -v "$(pwd)":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/app_data.tgz -C /data .
```

Restore onto empty volumes with the same compose project name so the volume names match:

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume create toposcope_ch_data
docker volume create toposcope_app_data
docker run --rm -v toposcope_ch_data:/data -v "$(pwd)":/backup alpine \
  tar xzf /backup/ch_data.tgz -C /data
docker run --rm -v toposcope_app_data:/data -v "$(pwd)":/backup alpine \
  tar xzf /backup/app_data.tgz -C /data
docker compose up -d
```

Compose may warn that `toposcope_ch_data` already exists and was not created by Compose. That is the restore. Do not set `external: true` on packaged `compose.yml`.

## Rollback

To roll back a packaged install, pin a previous published image tag in `compose.yml` and run `docker compose up -d`.

`0.3.14` is the first public pin, so there is no earlier public tag or image yet.

SQLite migrations are add-column. Extra columns on a downgrade are unused, not a wipe.

If a ClickHouse data directory from an older release refuses to start after the migration, use a restore rather than a tag pin.

## Health and metrics

`GET /api/health` and `GET /api/metrics` are open endpoints.

`GET /api/health` reports whether ClickHouse and SQLite are healthy.

`GET /api/metrics` returns Prometheus text.

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/metrics
```
